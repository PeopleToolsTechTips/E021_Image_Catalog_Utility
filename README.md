Utilty to view the design time images within the PeopleSoft system

I’m always looking for an appropriate image for my page. A button, an icon… something to improve the UI and help the user accomplish their task more efficiently.

Delivered PeopleSoft contains thousands of images and your implementation probably added many more.

Ironically, PeopleTools does not contain any delivered viewer for the images in it’s system. In the latest “PeopleSoft Planned Features and Enhancements” (Doc ID 1966243.2), Oracle has finally relented to adding a viewer for developers to see the images they are adding to the pages

Until PeopleSoft delivers this new functionality, we have to make due with custom utilities like this one.

The PeopleSoft Image Catalog is a simple utility allowing a developer to search for images by name or type and see the image object on the page instead of just relying on the image object name to be descriptive (it’s not).
